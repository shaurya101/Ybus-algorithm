# Ybus-algorithm
Formation of Y-Bus of the attached test system by using Bus Inspection Method.

Theory
------

Diagnol Elements 
Y11(for example) = 1/Impedances(for all buses connected) + Half Line Admittances + Self Admittance

Non-Diagnol Elements 
Y12=-y12=-y21 (ie negative of admittance of the connected buses)

General Method
--------------
  
  - Input the admittances
  - Solve seperately for Diagnol Elements and Non-Diagnol Elements
